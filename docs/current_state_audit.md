# Sentinel Risk — Current-State Audit

> **Status note.** This audit was written against an earlier, general-purpose financial-analysis version of the product. Sentinel Risk is now positioned as an English-only risk-management workbench with three desks (Credit Risk, Risk Methodology, Exposure Management) for analysts covering India, China, Japan and South Korea, and the desktop shell has moved to Tauri. Findings below are kept as a historical baseline; re-verify each one before acting on it.

## Scope examined

The repository contains an MIT-licensed Python CLI analytics engine, a React + Electron + FastAPI desktop scaffold, and a static marketing landing page. The intended product is an offline desktop tool for importing normalized CSV/XLSX statements, calculating financial ratios, showing dashboards, and generating reports.

## Evidence-based findings

| Area | Current state | Impact | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| Core-engine tests | `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v` currently fails: test fixtures do not include `cost_of_goods_sold` and `accounts_receivable`, both required by the current schema. | The advertised baseline is not regression-safe. | P0 |
| Desktop distributability | Electron spawns `python`/`python3` and `uvicorn` externally; the package configuration copies API files but does not package a Python runtime or demonstrated dependency environment. | A production installer cannot be assumed to work on a clean end-user system. | P0 |
| Product claims | The marketing page claims PDF export, branding, batch processing, custom ratios, schema auto-detection, API import, and multi-language support. These are absent or incomplete in the engine/desktop implementation. | Trust and conversion risk; scope must be aligned. | P0 |
| Import UX | The current UI accepts one dropped file and the engine demands a fixed canonical 16-column schema. There is no column-mapping flow, template download, sample import, detected-sheet selection, or row-level correction screen. | Users’ existing financial exports will often fail before seeing product value. | P0 |
| Export flow | The API creates chart/report files inside a temporary directory, returns their paths, and exits the temporary directory before response use. The desktop UI does not expose report download or export. | The desktop export promise is non-functional. | P0 |
| Regional formats | The interface is English only by design. Number, currency (INR, CNY, JPY, KRW, USD), unit (crore, lakh, million, billion) and fiscal-year formatting are not yet handled consistently across React, FastAPI, Matplotlib and HTML reports. | Figures from Indian, Chinese, Japanese and Korean filings can be misread without explicit currency and unit handling. | P0 |
| Market data model | Input is a single generic schema and does not model reporting basis, currency, scale, fiscal-year end, entity identity, industry, or taxonomy mappings. | Cross-company and cross-country comparisons could be misleading. | P0 |
| Desktop security | Electron uses `contextIsolation: true` and has Node integration disabled, which is a sound baseline. However no documented CSP, sandboxing policy, navigation/window-open policy, IPC sender validation, dependency security process, or release-signing implementation was found. API CORS allows all origins with credentials. | Security hardening is insufficient for public distribution. | P1 |
| Release engineering | Desktop target is Windows x64 only. No test automation or release verification workflow is present in the repository. Package scripts also reference `npm run lint` in the React project although no `lint` script is defined there. | No repeatable quality gate or global operating-system release path. | P1 |
| Analysis UX | The desktop shows two interactive chart panels and a categorical ratio table. It does not surface data quality insight, explanations, benchmarks, trend interpretation, alerts, reports, or disclosure of metric definitions. | The product behaves as a calculator rather than a decision-support product. | P1 |
| Ratio consistency | The engine computes `cash_flow_margin`, but it is missing from README’s published ratio list and several UI/report groupings. | Documentation and UI cannot be relied on as a complete representation of the engine. | P1 |

## Product implications

Sentinel Risk should first become a reliable, transparent, locally useful analysis product before expanding feature claims, countries, or paid tiers. The initial strategic wedge should be **offline, trustworthy financial-statement normalization and explainable ratio analytics for SMB finance teams, accountants, and analysts**. Coverage of India, China, Japan and South Korea should be designed around a canonical data model plus regional adapters for statement wording, currencies, units and fiscal calendars, with an English interface throughout.

## Research anchors

The external findings and their URLs are recorded in `docs/research_findings.md`. They support the priority of structured reporting data, explicit regional number and currency handling, desktop security hardening, and signed desktop distribution.
