# Sentinel Risk Evidence — Scope for Tax-Audit Intelligence

## Product boundary

Sentinel Risk should assist tax professionals in reviewing evidence and preparing auditable work products. It must **not** issue a tax filing position, certify compliance, calculate a taxpayer’s liability as an authoritative conclusion, or replace the judgment and sign-off of a licensed professional. Its output is a reviewed, evidence-linked draft for a human tax or audit reviewer.

## Coverage

English-language documents only. The extraction vocabulary covers tax wording common in India, China, Japan and South Korea (for example tax deducted at source, GST or consumption tax payable, late payment surcharge), amounts in INR, CNY, JPY, KRW and USD, crore and lakh units, and split fiscal years such as 2024-25. Tax-evidence review supports the Credit Risk desk's due-diligence work; it is not a tax calculation.

## Primary workflows

| Workflow | User question | Required system output |
|---|---|---|
| Intake and classification | What documents, periods, entities, and jurisdictions are present? | Immutable manifest, document classification, format detection, and missing-evidence list. |
| Evidence extraction | What claims, figures, adjustments, and citations appear in the report? | Structured facts with page/paragraph/table-cell citations and extraction confidence. |
| Reconciliation | Do report figures align with statements, ledgers, and prior-period evidence? | Deterministic reconciliation results, material differences, and source links. |
| Tax-risk review | Which reported assertions require human investigation? | Ranked review queue with policy/rule reference, evidence, confidence, and an explicit abstain state. |
| Workpaper composition | Can a reviewer defend the conclusion later? | Versioned Decision Proof with reviewer actions, unresolved items, and exportable audit trail. |

## Trust boundary

A model may classify, extract, cluster, compare, retrieve authoritative policy text, and draft a review note. It may not silently modify a financial fact, infer a missing tax position as a fact, or produce a final conclusion when required evidence is absent. Every machine-produced claim must be labeled as **confirmed calculation**, **review hypothesis**, or **unknown**.

## Initial measurable outcomes

| Outcome | Product metric | Quality guardrail |
|---|---|---|
| Faster evidence intake | Time from file selection to reviewable manifest | No source document or extracted fact is dropped without a visible exception. |
| Better extraction | Field-level precision/recall on a blinded gold set | A low-confidence field cannot be presented as confirmed. |
| More reliable reconciliation | Rate of material mismatch detection | Deterministic accounting controls always run before generative summaries. |
| Reviewer efficiency | Time from report intake to reviewer-ready workpaper | Human reviewer remains required for any blocking or material item. |
| Defensible output | Share of claims with a usable source citation | No policy or AI claim is exportable without evidence/provenance. |
